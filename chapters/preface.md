# Preface

My name is Salman Saeed.

This book is not merely a collection of stories — it is a living testament to a life shaped by values, sharpened by hardship, and lifted by imagination.

I began programming at the age of five on a cassette-driven MX-15 machine. I managed household finances at nine. I flew a plane on my first try, cleared ILS like a professional pilot, swam for three hours straight as a child, and built software when others were applying for jobs. I've served in the U.S. Army, passed securities exams, earned degrees in accounting, and built a company with fourteen entities across multiple sectors — all while facing the deepest tests of faith, integrity, and endurance.

I’ve been betrayed by family, loved deeply without return, wrongfully detained by governments, and sat through surgery and illness with a quiet heart. I’ve studied for finals in hospital gowns and returned favors from my childhood thirty-five years later — not for glory, but for balance. I’ve navigated moments when others panic with calm, because I believe peace is not the absence of pain, but presence of purpose.

This legacy is not written to prove brilliance. It is written to preserve truth. It is not a memoir of achievement; it is a story of character.

You will find in these pages a mind that refused limitation, a heart that refused hatred, and a life that searched — not for success — but for meaning.

And now, I invite you to walk through these stories — not just to see who I am, but maybe to remember a little more of who you are, too.

Salman Saeed
