### 12. A Trust Honored 🤝💰

In a world where money often breeds suspicion, I held steadfast to integrity as my guiding principle. Whenever entrusted with funds—whether personal or business—I treated it as a sacred responsibility.

I learned early on that true character isn’t measured by how much you have, but by how faithfully you manage what others have given you. Every transaction, every cent was handled with honesty and transparency.

This unwavering commitment to integrity built trust not only with friends and family but also in my professional life, opening doors that money alone could never unlock.
