# 🧠 The Gift and Curse of Control: My Journey Through OCD

## 🌪️ The Storm Within

I was just a child when I first noticed that my mind had a rhythm of its own — one that didn’t always cooperate with reality. I would repeat things, check things, and constantly feel like I had to _do something again_ to make it “right.” At the time, I didn’t have a word for it. But what I was experiencing was the early grip of **Obsessive Compulsive Disorder**.

And like many such things, it didn't appear out of nowhere.

## 🏚️ The House Without Shelter

We lived in a joint family system. While that sounds beautiful to some — filled with togetherness and laughter — it was _hell_ for me.

- 👵 My grandmother was abusive — not just emotionally, but physically.
- 🍞 Food was the cheapest, barely nutritious kind, made not with love, but resentment.
- 🚪 Privacy didn’t exist. Every evening the house became a den of guests.
- 👨‍👦 My uncle was intimidating, and his presence felt like constant surveillance.
- 💥 And my parents? Always fighting. Shouting matches were background noise in my formative years.

Imagine trying to develop a sense of _safety_ in that kind of environment. You can’t. So you start trying to _manufacture_ it. You create small rituals. You control what you can. And that’s what OCD gave me — a **false sense of control** in a world that felt out of control.

## 💔 A Void Called Love

Then came Shemaila. She was elegant, poetic, refined. When I spoke with her, something miraculous happened — **the noise stopped**. My racing thoughts paused. For a few precious moments, I felt peace.

This wasn't just romance. This was medicinal.

She looked like the women I had long admired but couldn't reach — my stylish aunt Razia with blue eyes and long nails, her daughter Maryam whom I once wanted to marry and got rejected for, and even resembled my own mother, a professor — strict but intellectually strong.

Shemaila was like a fusion of all the feminine archetypes my mind had catalogued through the chaos.

When she left, it wasn’t just heartbreak. It was like the only _anchor_ that kept the storm inside me at bay had snapped loose.

And my OCD? It surged.

## 🧬 The Need to Reclaim Control

Why does one develop OCD? For me, it was my mind’s desperate attempt to impose order where there was none.

- 🔁 If I could repeat something perfectly, maybe the pain would not repeat.
- 📏 If I could measure and count and align, maybe I wouldn’t feel so invisible in a chaotic home.
- ❌ If I did _everything right_, maybe someone — my father — would keep their promise.

The **4.0 GPA promise** was a defining moment. I earned it, from a U.S. university no less. But my father didn’t hold up his end of the deal to talk to Shemaila’s family.

That single act told me: “Even when you do everything perfectly, you’re not safe.”
And the OCD dug in deeper.

## 🛤️ The Healing Path

But here I am now. Not cured — but evolving.

- 🧘 I meditate.
- 🌌 I study consciousness and metaphysics.
- 🎧 I stopped memorizing ghazals to hold on to someone who no longer matters.
- 🤝 I have built relationships rooted in trust and mutual joy.
- ✍️ And I am finally writing my story.

OCD was my mind’s way of coping. But today, I no longer need those crutches to feel safe. I create that safety for myself.

## 🕯️ Final Words

If you have OCD, or any pattern that feels compulsive, know this:

> It wasn’t born in weakness. It was born in survival.

Honor it for the protection it once gave you. Then, slowly — gently — let it go.

Because your healing doesn't mean _you change who you are_.
It means you _remember who you were before the world taught you to fear being yourself_.
