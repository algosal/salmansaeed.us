### 13. Survey on the Platform 🚉📝

One day, while waiting on a train platform, I noticed a stranger conducting a survey. Something about the questions piqued my curiosity, and though I was on my way somewhere important, I chose to stay a bit longer.

I missed my train because I wanted to complete that stranger’s research. To most, it might have seemed trivial or inconvenient, but for me, it was an act of connection and contribution.

That small choice reflected my belief that sometimes the meaningful moments are found in the unexpected — and that helping others, even in little ways, can create ripple effects far beyond what we see.
