### 15. A Soldier’s Calm 🪖🧘‍♂️

Life threw some harsh tests my way — moments that could have shattered my spirit. From being detained unjustly to struggling through detox, I faced fear, uncertainty, and pressure that would break many.

But I learned to stay centered.

Like a soldier in the heat of battle, I cultivated calm — a quiet strength that steadied my mind and body even in chaos. Whether behind bars or confronting addiction’s grip, I relied on inner discipline and resilience.

This calm wasn’t numbness. It was clarity. A conscious choice to respond rather than react. To maintain dignity when everything around seemed designed to erode it.

It’s a lesson in grace under fire, and one I carry with me still.
