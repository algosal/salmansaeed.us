### Purpose, Not Paychecks ðŸ’¼ðŸ”¥

Early on in my career, I faced a crossroads many do â€” the choice between a steady paycheck and pursuing my true purpose. Jobs were available, comfortable and secure, but none ignited the fire within me.

I chose innovation over employment.

Rather than settling, I dedicated myself to building, creating, and pushing boundaries. I understood that fulfillment comes from meaning, not just money. That inner drive to manifest ideas into reality fueled me far more than any salary ever could.

It was a leap of faith â€” risky, uncertain â€” but one that defined my path. Because when you follow purpose first, financial success often follows, but more importantly, you live a life aligned with your deepest values.
