### ðŸ’¾ Programming by Cassette: A Childhood Coded in Curiosity and Sound ðŸŽµ

At the tender age of 5, while most kids were just starting to learn their letters, I was diving headfirst into the world of programming â€” on an MX-15 computer that stored its data on cassette tapes. Yes, you read that right: cassette tapes! ðŸŽ¶

Imagine the crackling sound as the tape whirred, loading lines of code one slow beep at a time. Each program was like a little treasure hidden inside those magnetic strips. It required patience, precision, and a spark of imagination â€” qualities that have stayed with me ever since.

This early exposure didnâ€™t just teach me how to code; it taught me how to think logically and creatively. It ignited a lifelong passion for technology and problem-solving, setting the foundation for all my future ventures in tech and entrepreneurship.

Despite the primitive technology, the thrill of making a computer understand my commands was magical. It showed me that with curiosity and determination, even the simplest tools can unlock vast possibilities.
