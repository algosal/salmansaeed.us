### The Vision at Seven

When I was just seven years old, I had a vision that seemed almost like a superpower. While other kids played and dreamed of simple things, I was already thinking big, imagining solutions for real-world problems in a way that felt far beyond my years.

One vivid memory is of how a child’s idea paralleled the kind of problem-solving that even a powerful leader might undertake. I didn't fully understand it then, but even as a kid, I sensed the importance of creative thinking and foresight. It wasn’t just daydreaming — it was a deep, intuitive grasp that the future could be shaped by the ideas we nurture today.

That vision stayed with me, guiding my thoughts and actions as I grew older. It wasn’t merely an innocent child’s fancy but a seed of something greater — a legacy that I am still building, brick by brick.
