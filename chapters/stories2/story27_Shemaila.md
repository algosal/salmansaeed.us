# 🌺 The Woman Who Was All of Them: Fragments of the Feminine

## 👦🏽 The Boy, the Void, and the Beginning

When I was fifteen, I met a girl named **Shemaila** — a presence so enigmatic, so subtly powerful, that I could not understand then _why_ I loved her. But the emotion was undeniable. Years later, with deep reflection and healing, I’ve begun to see the architecture of that affection.

It wasn’t love at first sight.  
It was love at first familiarity. 🌀

## 👩‍🔬 She and My Mother: A Paradoxical Mirror

My mother was a **professor of biochemistry** — brilliant, driven, but emotionally distant and often critical. Years later, Shemaila also became a **professor of physiology** at the same medical college. The symmetry was striking. 🧪📚

But where my mother lacked warmth, Shemaila radiated it. She had **long, elegant nails**, a **graceful presence**, and a poetic mind.  
She read _Ghalib_ — not casually, but deeply, like someone who had lived the ache in his verses.  
When I told my father about her quoting Ghalib, he quietly said,

> “She’s very intelligent.”

That struck me.  
Shemaila wasn't just a girl.  
She was _recognition_. A mirrored memory. A correction.

## 👁️ A Ghost from Another Woman: Razia

But it wasn’t just my mother that Shemaila resembled.  
She reminded me of my **aunt Razia** — a woman with blue eyes, long nails, and striking Western beauty, who looked almost Caucasian.  
I admired her silently. I once asked my uncle about marrying her daughter Maryam, but he rejected the idea outright. That rejection left a silent mark. ❌💔

As Shemaila aged, she **began to look _exactly_ like Razia** — same face, same fashionable flair, same magnetic silence.  
She became not one woman, but _all_ the women I’d ever silently longed for —  
the ones I could never reach, never possess, never hold.

## 🧠 The Amygdala, the Memory, and the Parabola

Shemaila once told me she would never marry me —

> "Not even if you were the last man on Earth."  
> It burned. But strangely, it _bound_ me.

Years later, I realized something:

> Love and hate both stir the **amygdala**, the brain’s emotional epicenter. 💥  
> Her hatred was still _energy_ — the vector was wrong, but the charge was real.

In a sense, her dismissal created a **parabola**: a soaring emotional trajectory that had nowhere to land. It rose. It looped. It returned — again and again.

## 🎧 Ghalib, OCD, and the Ghazals That Healed

After her rejection, I developed a quiet obsession.  
I began listening to _Ghalib’s ghazals_, especially the ones sung by **Jagjit Singh**.  
I memorized them — word for word. 🎶📝

Why?  
Because her voice was silent now.  
And the _ghazals_ were echoes of her.

I had OCD as a child — obsessive, looping thoughts. But when I spoke to Shemaila,

> ❄️ _those thoughts disappeared_.

She brought peace. She was silence in the storm.

## 🧬 The Erotic Confusion and the Sacred Wish

For a long time, I couldn’t even **masturbate to the thought of her**.  
Not out of shame — but because she existed in a realm beyond physicality.  
She was _motherly_, _spiritual_, _divine_.  
She was the **first woman** I ever **imagined having children with**. 🍼✨

What did that mean?

It meant I didn’t want to consume her.  
I wanted to _continue_ her.

## 🏚️ The Household in Chaos

All of this unfolded in an emotional war zone.

- We lived in a **joint family system**.
- My **grandmother** was abusive — cursing and hitting us regularly.
- **Privacy didn’t exist**; guests swarmed our home every evening.
- My **parents fought constantly**.
- **My uncle was intimidating**, domineering, controlling.

And amidst all that noise...  
She was **stillness**.  
She was _everything the house was not_.

## 🧭 The Broken Promise and the Void

My father told me if I would earn a 4.0 GPA he promised to speak to Shemaila’s family.  
I earned that GPA — not in Pakistan, but from the **State University of New York**.  
He broke his word.  
Instead, he asked me for money. 💸

I gave it.  
Silently.  
Because _some sons grow past their fathers_ — not in rebellion, but in resilience.

## 🌅 What Changed Now?

It took me **29 years** to release her.  
Today, I can **think of her during masturbation** — something impossible before.  
I rarely listen to Ghalib now. I forget the ghazals I once memorized.  
And I don’t love her anymore.

But I understand her.

She was a **composite figure** —

- My mother’s intellect
- Razia’s beauty
- Maryam’s lost potential
- My unmet need for peace
- My yearning for safety
- My ache for validation
- And above all, my blueprint for the sacred feminine 🌸

## 💡 Commentary

> Shemaila was never just Shemaila.  
> She was **the Feminine Ideal**, shaped by childhood trauma and wrapped in poetry.

Your story wasn’t just about _her_ — it was about _you_:

- Your _OCD_ needing stillness 🧘‍♂️
- Your _emotional wounds_ needing maternal warmth 👩‍👦
- Your _aesthetic yearning_ for beauty, intelligence, and purity 🌷
- Your _longing for loyalty_, projected onto women like Razia 🤝

And perhaps, she also served as a spiritual signal:

> That the love we chase outside… is the healing we must offer _within_. 💫

## 🕊️ Final Thought

Shemaila was the **woman who was all of them**.  
But today, you are the **man who is all of you**.

🧠💔📿📖🎶🌿💫  
Her memory may revisit you — that’s okay.  
Let it come. Let it go. Let it pass.
