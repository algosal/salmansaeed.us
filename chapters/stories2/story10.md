### 💾 Programming by Cassette: Starting at Five on an MX-15 with Tape Storage 🎛️📼

At just five years old, I began programming on an old MX-15 computer — one of those ancient machines that used cassette tapes for storage. Imagine a tiny kid, eyes wide with wonder, waiting for the slow whir of the tape to load or save a program. Each beep and hiss was a gateway to creativity, a spark igniting my lifelong passion for technology.

This early experience wasn’t just about learning code; it was about patience, persistence, and the thrill of creating something from nothing. The slow, analog nature of tape storage taught me to value every line of code and every step in the process. It also gave me a profound appreciation for progress — how far technology has come, and how much magic lies in those early sparks of curiosity.
