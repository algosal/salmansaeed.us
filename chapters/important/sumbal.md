That behavior is often called **“emotional baiting”** or part of a **push-pull dynamic** — and it typically signals **emotional immaturity, control issues, or insecurity**. Here’s a breakdown of what may be going on underneath:

---

### 🔄 Push-Pull Behavior: The Core Pattern

**She gives you warmth and validation (pull) → disappears (push) → returns like nothing happened (pull again).**

This cycle achieves two things for her:

1. **Maintains control** — she controls when connection happens.
2. **Keeps you guessing** — unpredictability keeps your attention hooked.

---

### 📡 What It Might Mean

#### 1. **She Craves Emotional Power**

The silence makes _you_ wonder:

- “Did I say something wrong?”
- “Is she okay?”
- “Why did she disappear?”

If you start reaching out or worrying, she feels **powerful and wanted**.

> It’s not malicious in all cases — sometimes it’s subconscious. But it’s still manipulation.

---

#### 2. **She Uses Emotional Resetting to Avoid Depth**

She might fear:

- Being too vulnerable
- Being known too deeply
- Losing control of the connection

So after she says “every good thing,” she disappears to _re-establish emotional distance._

When she returns, she acts like nothing happened — as if pressing a reset button — so you don’t challenge her or ask for more depth or consistency.

---

#### 3. **Avoidant Attachment Style**

This is classic behavior of someone with an **avoidant attachment**:

- They enjoy connection, but only on **their** terms
- When intimacy starts feeling “too much,” they pull away
- Once they feel safe again, they return — but without addressing the rupture

---

#### 4. **Testing You for Neediness**

In some cases, she may be _testing how reactive or needy_ you are:

- If you blow up or beg during silence → you “fail” the test
- If you stay calm and self-contained → she respects you more

Twisted? A bit. But again, many do this _unconsciously_, based on past relational trauma or games learned early in life.

### 🧘‍♂️ What You Can Do

1. **Stay centered. Don’t chase. Don’t punish.**

   - Let her silence be hers. Use that time for yourself.

2. **Mirror her energy.**

   - If she goes silent, you don’t need to double your effort. When she returns, **be kind but don’t act like nothing happened**. Hold her to reality. If needed, say:

     > “Hey, I enjoy our conversations, but when you go quiet like that without saying anything, it creates confusion. I value clarity.”

3. **Track patterns, not words.**

   - If this becomes a habit and she resists honest communication, then you’re not dealing with someone emotionally available. _You’re dealing with someone rehearsing intimacy without stepping into it._

### 🧠 Final Insight:

> Saying “all the right things” but disappearing is not connection. It’s performance.

Real love doesn’t flinch in silence, nor does it treat your time like a waiting room.

If she’s genuine, she’ll value consistency.
If she’s not, her patterns will expose her.

You already have the clarity — you're just seeking confirmation. And yes: **you’re right to pause and question it.**

Let me know if you want to explore how to set boundaries gently, or move on cleanly.
