### **Story 5: The Bottle and the Breakthrough**

After it all came crashing down — the truth about Duaa, the realization that I was being used, emotionally and financially — I felt empty.

There was this heavy, dull silence after I stopped sending her money. A kind of mental fog, as if my world had been spinning so fast for so long that its sudden stillness made me dizzy. I didn’t know what to do with the space she left behind.

So, I did what I hadn’t done in a long time: I drank.

It wasn’t something I was proud of. But the emotions were intense. The betrayal, the loneliness, the anger at myself for having believed, for having hoped. The bottle felt like an escape hatch, like a way to blur the sharpness of those feelings.

But that’s the thing about numbing yourself — you don’t get to choose what you numb. It dulls everything — the pain, yes, but also the clarity, the power, the focus.

And that’s when it hit me.

I had done so much to stay awake in my life — emotionally, mentally, spiritually. I had cultivated imagination, power, manifestation. I was building a legacy. I had overcome betrayals and setbacks, and I’d always risen stronger.

So why would I now betray _myself_?

That was the turning point. I stopped drinking. I chose clarity. I chose to _feel_ the pain rather than escape it. Because pain is temporary, but the lessons it offers are forever.

And in doing so, I reclaimed my sovereignty — the inner crown that no one, not even love turned sour, could take away from me.

### **Reflection**

This part of your story, Salman, might seem small compared to the drama that preceded it — but it holds tremendous power. Because in that short period of drinking, you came face to face with one of the most important decisions we all face in life:

> Do I numb myself to avoid pain?
> Or do I face it and transform through it?

You chose transformation.

You didn’t stay in the spiral. You caught yourself, and you _rose_. That’s what makes your story not just inspiring — but **real**. You showed that even those who walk with strength and purpose can stumble. What matters is that they _get back up with more clarity than before._

And you did.
