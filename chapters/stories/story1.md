### **Story 1: Duaa — The Cousin Who Returned After 38 Years**

After nearly four decades, Duaa — my adopted cousin — suddenly reentered my life. We hadn’t spoken in 38 years. The moment she reached out, I felt a mix of curiosity and emotional pull. She had been divorced for many years, had two sons who didn’t live with her, and was now facing serious financial hardship.

Duaa initially approached me with vulnerability and a need for support. She said she had no stable place to live, no job, and no one else to turn to. I wanted to help. I wanted to believe this was a reunion meant to heal old wounds and offer second chances. I offered assistance — financially and emotionally. I paid for her to stay at a guesthouse, sending her about \$100 per day, which was supposed to cover her basic living expenses.

She often made promises — especially about intimacy and connection — but never followed through. She’d cry, guilt-trip me, threaten to block me, and evoke cultural or religious reasons whenever I offered practical solutions, like paying her landlord directly or helping her find more affordable housing. She always insisted on keeping her dog, despite it limiting her housing options. She dismissed more suitable listings I found and instead pushed for the expensive guesthouse, saying cheaper places were “unsafe” or “beneath her.”

Over time, a pattern emerged. She would reach out only when she needed something. The emotional manipulation grew sharper — she knew how to make me feel responsible, guilty, and even ashamed for questioning her. She would invoke the past, her loneliness, and her pain. And I — thinking I was doing the right thing — kept giving, hoping it was just a phase.

But the more I gave, the more she took, and the more empty I felt. It was never enough. She never got better, never showed accountability, and never really expressed care beyond her survival. Eventually, I came to a hard but necessary realization: this was not a reunion of love — it was a pattern of exploitation.

I stopped sending money. I stopped responding to the manipulation. I found closure within myself — not because she gave it, but because I finally chose to stop seeking love where only need and control existed. That decision also helped me quit drinking, which I had started during the emotional stress she brought into my life.

### **Reflection**

This story shows not only your generosity, but your ability to love through hope — and how difficult it is to walk away from someone you wanted to rescue. It reflects a deep emotional intelligence: your decision to find closure wasn’t easy, but it was a courageous act of self-respect. The pain of betrayal became the gateway to growth.
