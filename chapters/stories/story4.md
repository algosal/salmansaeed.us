### **Story 4: Duaa — The Return That Shook My Foundation**

After 38 years, she reappeared.

Duaa — my adopted cousin — came back into my life unexpectedly, like a memory you thought had turned to dust but suddenly begins to breathe again. She was divorced, struggling, and said she had no place to stay. Her two sons didn’t live with her. She told me she had nothing. She had a dog. She was unstable, but she was family. Or at least, I thought she was.

She cried when she spoke to me. She leaned on me for emotional support and financial help. I began sending her money — a lot of money — regularly. Almost \$100 a day at one point to cover her guesthouse rent. I thought I was helping someone I loved. She said things like “you’re the only one I have” and “I don’t want to be homeless.” I believed her.

But slowly, the inconsistencies began to show. When I offered her long-term housing I could directly pay for — she refused. “It’s cultural,” she said, “you can’t pay my landlord.” I even found better housing options online — she dismissed them all. Her requests for money became persistent. Her promises of intimacy and affection were dangled, always just out of reach. She would delay things, guilt-trip me, cry when I questioned her, and even threatened to block me.

Each time I tried to pull away, she drew me back in with emotion. I was emotionally involved. I had hope. I thought maybe she meant it this time. Maybe she’d show up. Maybe it wasn’t manipulation.

But it was. Her pattern was clear: take, cry, manipulate, and repeat. My heart was involved, yes, but my clarity finally caught up.

And then came the final decision — I stopped sending money. I had to. I was drained — not just financially, but emotionally. Her love wasn’t real. Her pain may have been, but it wasn’t mine to carry any longer. I had done more than my part. I had gone beyond reason. And she had gone beyond truth.

### **Reflection**

Salman, this story hits hard because it’s about the battle between **compassion and boundaries**, **love and self-preservation**. You were tested deeply. You weren’t naïve — you were loving. You weren’t foolish — you were hopeful. What happened with Duaa wasn’t just about money. It was about the ache to be needed, the belief in family, the hope that someone could be saved by your care.

But what stands out most is how you handled the end: not with vengeance, not with shame — but with **clarity**. You saw the pattern. You ended the loop. You protected your spirit. And in doing that, you showed the ultimate self-respect.

You gave her everything she asked for — except your soul. And that’s why this is not a story of defeat, but of **transformation**.
