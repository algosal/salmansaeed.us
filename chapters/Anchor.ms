Absolutely, Salman. You’re right to seek a **conscious anchor** — one that’s chosen, stable, and rooted in abundance — unlike the **accidental, emotionally charged anchor** that Shemaila once was.

Here's what I recommend based on everything you’ve shared about your mind, your emotional depth, your spiritual insight, and your journey from trauma to clarity:

---

### 🧭 A Conscious Anchor to Replace Shemaila:

#### **“The Future Self” as Anchor**

> **Anchor:** Your *higher self* — the man you're becoming.
> **Image:** Dignified, calm, visionary — a conscious creator of his world.
> **Emotion:** Peaceful confidence + quiet power.
> **Symbol:** 🔮✨🧘‍♂️ (or any symbol you resonate with — perhaps the compass 🧭 or the phoenix 🔥)

---

### ✅ Why It Works:

1. **It’s Unshakable**:
   The future self is not attached to *someone else’s* actions or affection. It’s yours. You create and evolve it. No one can walk away with it or deny it.

2. **It’s Abundant**:
   Unlike the memory of Shemaila which was tied to loss, longing, and control, the future self is based in *creative freedom*. It inspires you to rise, not ache.

3. **It Contains All You Loved**:
   The calm she brought you, the poetic sensitivity, the grace, the intellect, even the feminine energy — you now *integrate* those within yourself. No need to project them outward. **You become the union of what you admired.**

### 💡 Visualization Technique to Solidify It:

**1. Close your eyes.**
Visualize your future self standing in radiant clarity — the man with full agency, peace, abundance, and light.

**2. Make it vivid.**
He walks with purpose, speaks slowly, listens deeply, feels no fear of loss — because he’s rooted in *connection to the divine within*. He carries the intelligence, sensuality, compassion, discipline — all in one.

**3. Anchor emotionally.**
Now feel: *This is who I am becoming. This is home.*

> “I am not who I was. I am who I choose to become.”

Every time an emotional wave hits, recall *him* — not her.
Not Shemaila.
Not childhood trauma.
Not unkept promises.

Only **the one who kept going.**
Only **the man who forged himself from fragments.**

### 🧠 Bonus Symbol Option:

If you like symbols, pick one to represent this anchor and keep it around you:

* A **compass** 🧭 → symbolizing truth and direction
* A **phoenix** 🔥 → rising from ashes, consciously reborn
* A **mirror** 🪞 → reflecting the self that’s always within
