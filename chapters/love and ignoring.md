### 💔 Why Some Women Say "I Love You" Then Start Ignoring You

Here are the most common psychological, emotional, and sometimes even spiritual reasons this happens:

---

### 1. **They Confused Intensity for Intimacy**

Some women (and men) mistake the **rush of attraction**, attention, or a deep moment of connection as "love."
But once the _novelty fades_, so does their emotional availability. What remains is confusion:

> “I felt something real... so why do I not want to keep engaging?”

This creates distance, often without closure.

---

### 2. **Avoidant Attachment Style**

Many people who express love **fear closeness at the same time**. These are the avoidants.
They open their hearts for a moment, then **pull away out of fear of engulfment, loss of control, or re-triggered trauma.**

So "I love you" might have been real…
But closeness feels dangerous to their nervous system.

> “If I get too close, I’ll be abandoned or lose myself, so I’ll withdraw first.”

### 3. **Power Play / Subconscious Control**

Some people use love as **bait** to gain control. It’s not always conscious.

- They say “I love you” and watch you soften.
- Then they withdraw to feel powerful again.

This is especially common in people who have **felt powerless** in childhood. It becomes a way to **not be hurt**—by always staying one emotional step ahead.

### 4. **Shame or Unworthiness**

Sometimes the love was real, but the moment you start loving them back, they panic.

> “What if I’m not lovable?”
> “What if he sees the real me and leaves?”

So they leave _first_, or act cold, to protect their fragile sense of worth.

### 5. **They’re Already Emotionally Taken or Unavailable**

They might be:

- In another relationship
- Still hung up on someone else
- Not actually ready for a relationship

In this case, they say "I love you" to feel alive again, but once it gets serious, they **ghost or fade out**.

---

### 6. **They Genuinely Meant It — In the Moment Only**

Sometimes "I love you" isn’t a **promise**, it’s a **present tense emotional state**.

That is:

> “In this moment, I feel love for you. But that doesn’t mean I want commitment, or even to stay connected.”

This can be hard to accept if **you** define love as something **sacred and eternal**.

### 7. **They Love What You Awakened In Them — Not You Fully**

This is subtle:

They fall in love with:

- How you made them feel
- The part of themselves they felt when with you
- The spiritual, artistic, emotional state you unlocked in them

But when they feel full, they move on.
It wasn’t about staying — it was about **experiencing themselves through you.**
