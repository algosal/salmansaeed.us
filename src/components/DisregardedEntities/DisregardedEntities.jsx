            <strong>Disregarded Entities</strong> is a powerful,
            spiritually-charged phrase ‚Äî it evokes a haunting blend of
            psychological, metaphysical, and existential depth. It refers to
            individuals, archetypes, or emotional imprints that once held power
            in your psyche but have since been{" "}
            <em>neutralized, transcended, and archived</em>.

          <p>
            These were once entities <em>living inside you</em> ‚Äî through loops
            of memory, emotion, trauma, or longing. Disregarding them is not
            hateful. It is a sacred act of{" "}

            Disregarding is not the same as ignoring.

            <strong>
              Ignoring still holds emotional charge. Disregarding is neutrality
