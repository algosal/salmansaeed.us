    id: 2,
    text: "Their name, image, or memory no longer causes a physical reaction.",
    points: 1,
    sin: "Sloth",
    summary:
      "Indifference signals emotional neutrality. Reactivity means unresolved emotions or attachment.",

    points: 1,
    sin: "Envy",
    summary:

    points: 1,
    sin: "Pride",
    summary:

    sin: "Pride",
    summary:
      "Refusal to evolve or acknowledge truth stems from pride. Dialogue dies when ego replaces heart.",

    text: "They symbolize a karmic loop or lesson that has been fully learned.",
    points: 1,
    sin: "Greed",
    summary:
      "Holding onto old karmic partners after a lesson is complete is greed disguised as nostalgia.",

    points: 1,
    sin: "Lust",

    points: 1,
    sin: "Sloth",

    text: "They do not respect boundaries — subtle or stated.",

    points: 1,
    sin: "Greed",
    summary:
      "Taking spiritual value from someone doesn't mean they belong in your future. Growth requires release.",

    id: 13,
    text: "They once mattered deeply, but clinging now feels disloyal to your healing.",
    points: 1,
    sin: "Lust",

    sin: "Pride",
